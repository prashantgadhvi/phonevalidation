# Phone Number Validation

## Directions
Using HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript (or any superset of JS) create a website that processes the file 
located in data/phone.csv. Your website should:

1. Allow the user to upload a file (UI partially implemented)
2. Validate the file uploaded is a CSV and the CSV has a “phone” column
3. Validate whether or not each row contains a valid Canadian phone number
4. Output 2 separate lists, one with valid phone numbers and one with invalid phone numbers
5. Valid phone numbers should be in the format +13061234567. Invalid phone numbers should be in their original format

Please include any unit tests as part of your project. You could also include a written description 
of how you would test this code.
